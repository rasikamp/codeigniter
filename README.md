# codeigniter
A server implementation for CodeIgniter using one model, one config file and one controller.

Requirements:
codeigniter framework
xampp
bootstrap files

Execution:
Codeigniter works on MVC structure. Hence we need to create files in model,controller and view folders. 
The name of the file in the controller is Auth.php. Auth is my controller and login ,dashboard,etc are my methods by which will execute. The register.php, login.php and dashboard.php are the files in the views folder. Those are the files for the user interface. The third folder is model in which Auth_model is created.
